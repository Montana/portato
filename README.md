Portato is a GUI for the package manager of Gentoo - Portage. 

## Why? 

The author has stated "Portato does not work with current versions of portage. Hence I asked to remove it from Gentoo. I do not know, if I will ever make it work again. So please step up if you are interested in getting it running again."

Original depracated project: https://necoro.dev/portato/

## Now what?

So, I'll take the request and have Portato back in the grips of Gentoo users hopefully mid-to-late 2022.
